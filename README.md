# SZAPP

Sterkte Zwakte Analyse App (SZAPP) helps teachers to assess their students with colors and keep overview over their learning progress.
Students can first evaluate their performance with a color (green, lightgreen, yellow or red). Then, the teacher can assess their work with a color also. Students can retry the competence as many times as needed. The last evaluation is always taken into account for progress reports.
